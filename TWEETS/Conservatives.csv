The role itself comes with a £4bn investment in our infrastructure, transport, jobs and regeneration. A chance to fix the roads, improve transport links, to invest in our town centres, amongst other things. 

Obviously we know our roads and bus network need major investment, so I've worked to secure this new funding so we can sort it. This is the only route to getting the money that's needed to do it.

As Mayor I'll also work to make our services more effective, bringing local Councils and stakeholders under one umbrella so that we can plan together, reduce duplication and all be working towards the same goals. 

Historically we've struggled as a region because our governance is so complex; across 18 different Councils we often don't agree, don't work together, and don't have a shared narrative to explain to Government what it is we're trying to achieve. That's meant we've had less investment than other places, so this change is a key opportunity to fix that and get everybody on the same page! 

I also want to bring down more funding from Government to invest in community groups and services, in youth services, in grassroots sports, arts and culture and lots of other areas where currently these organisations end up competing for one off bits of grant funding and have no certainty. They can't plan for the future. By doing this locally instead of from London we can work with groups better, and offer longer term support, so that local groups and clubs can thrive. 

So as well as those key infrastructure priorities; roads and transport, and major new investment, there's loads more to go at too. Loads of positives we could deliver. 

It's not risk free though. Giving these powers to the wrong Mayor could make a mess. Labour Mayors elsewhere have raised taxes, or introduced driving charges. So I need your help to prevent this, and to deliver the positive outcomes I've described.

For my part, I'm born and raised in Derbyshire, I live and work in Nottinghamshire, and I know our communities well. Im 100% committed to making sure we get our fair share of funding and support, and that every community in our region can benefit. So that's my commitment to you.
